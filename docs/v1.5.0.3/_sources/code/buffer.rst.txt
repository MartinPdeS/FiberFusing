.. autoclass:: FiberFusing.buffer.Circle
    :members:
    :inherited-members:
    :member-order: bysource

    The `Circle` class represents circular geometric structures, typically used for modeling fiber cross-sections. It provides methods for defining, scaling, and manipulating circular geometries.

.. autoclass:: FiberFusing.buffer.Square
    :members:
    :inherited-members:
    :member-order: bysource

    The `Square` class defines square-shaped geometric structures. This class is used for specific scenarios where rectangular shapes are necessary, and it includes methods for configuring and transforming these geometries.
